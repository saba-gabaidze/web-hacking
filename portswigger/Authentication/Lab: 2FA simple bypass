2FA Simple Bypass – Accessing Account Without Verification Code

Lab Difficulty: Apprentice
Vulnerability: Broken Authentication / 2FA Bypass

Summary
This lab had two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, but the implementation was flawed. After logging in with valid credentials, the app asked for a verification code — sounds secure, right? But turns out, you could just skip the 2FA step by manually going to a protected page. No code needed.

Steps Taken
Logged in as usual using the provided user:
wiener : peter

After entering the correct password, it asked me for a 2FA code. Fine. Clicked the "Email client" button and checked my inbox — got the code instantly.

Before doing anything else, I headed to /my-account to see what the authenticated area looked like. Just poking around.

Cool. Now I logged out.

Next, I tried logging in with the victim’s credentials:
carlos : montoya

Same thing — password accepted, but then it stopped and asked for a 2FA code. Of course, I didn’t have access to Carlos’s email, so no way to get the actual code.

Instead of giving up or guessing the code, I just changed the URL manually to /my-account.

And… it worked.

No code entered. No verification. Just straight into Carlos’s account page. Lab solved.

Root Cause
The application enforced 2FA on the login flow, but not on the backend. Basically, once you’re past the password check, it sets some kind of session — and the 2FA gate is only protecting the user interface, not the actual resources.

So if you skip the front door and just go around to the side, you’re in. Classic case of access control being handled on the client side (bad idea).

Fixes and Mitigation
2FA should be validated server-side before granting access to any authenticated endpoints.

Protected resources like /my-account should check whether the user fully passed the 2FA step.

Don’t rely on just frontend flow control — always enforce it at the backend.

Ideally, the server should flag the session as "2FA incomplete" until it’s fully verified, and reject any access until that’s cleared.
