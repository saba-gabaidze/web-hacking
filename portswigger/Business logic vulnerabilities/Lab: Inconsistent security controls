## Overview / What I Learned

This lab demonstrates how flawed logic in access control checks can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation.  
Access to admin functionality was mistakenly granted based on the user's email domain, rather than robust authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Key Takeaway**: Email domains should never be used as a trust boundary for access control.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Used Burp engagment content discovery tool
- Browsed to `/admin` manually.
- Page returned a message: “Only employees of DontWannaCry can access this page.”
- Hinted that access may depend on the user's **email domain**.

### 2. Account Registration
- Registered a new user with an arbitrary email using the lab’s custom domain:
test@<your-lab-id>.web-security-academy.net
- Confirmed registration via the lab's email client.

### 3. Email Manipulation
- Logged in, then navigated to the "My account" page.
- Changed the registered email to:
test@dontwannacry.com

- Successfully updated the email without re-verification.

### 4. Privilege Escalation
- Revisited `/admin` and gained access to the admin panel.

### 5. Lab Completion
- In the admin panel, found the option to delete user `carlos`.
- Clicked "Delete" — lab solved.

## Lessons Learned

- Never implement authorization logic based on client-controlled values like email domains.
- Always enforce server-side access controls based on roles or privileges stored securely in the backend.
