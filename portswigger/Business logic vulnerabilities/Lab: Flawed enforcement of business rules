- Reinforced the importance of **server-side validation** in discount and transaction logic.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Initial Setup
- Logged in using provided credentials:  
  - `wiener:peter`
- Collected two coupon codes:
  - `NEWCUST5` (shown on site)
  - `SIGNUP30` (received after newsletter signup)

### 2. Cart Preparation
- Added the **Lightweight l33t leather jacket** to the cart.

### 3. Coupon Abuse
- Applied coupons in alternating order:
  - `SIGNUP30` → accepted  
  - `NEWCUST5` → accepted  
  - `SIGNUP30` → accepted again  
  - `NEWCUST5` → accepted again  
  - Repeated alternation until the price dropped below available store credit

### 4. Final Purchase
- Completed checkout once the discounted total was under store credit.
- Successfully bought the item and solved the lab.

## Technical Takeaways

- Logic flaws often occur in multi-step workflows like checkout systems.
- Lack of tracking or limiting unique coupon use per session/account can lead to abuse.
- Coupon reuse prevention should **persist across the transaction** and not just per individual input.
