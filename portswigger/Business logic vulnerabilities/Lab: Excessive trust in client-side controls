## Overview / What I Learned

This lab demonstrates a common logic flaw in e-commerce applications: trusting the client to supply sensitive data like product prices. It shows how client-manipulable parameters can be abused if not validated on the server side.

Key lesson: All sensitive calculations (like pricing) must be performed server-side. Never trust user input for security-critical data.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Initial Setup
- Logged in as user `wiener:peter`.
- Tried to purchase the "Lightweight l33t leather jacket" and received an error due to insufficient store credit.

### 2. Intercepting Add to Cart
- Intercepted the `POST /cart` request using Burp Suite.
- The request included a `price` parameter:
  
POST /cart HTTP/1.1
Host: target

productId=3&redir=PRODUCT&quantity=1&price=1337


### 3. Manipulating the Price
- Sent the intercepted request to Burp Repeater.
- Changed `price=1337` to `price=5`.
- Sent the modified request and confirmed via cart page that the price had changed.

### 4. Final Purchase
- Proceeded to checkout.
- Successfully purchased the jacket at the modified price using available store credit.
- Lab marked as solved.
