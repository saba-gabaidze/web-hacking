Information Disclosure in Error Messages

Lab Difficulty: Apprentice
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure / Verbose Error Messages
Lab Link: PortSwigger Lab

Summary
This lab demonstrates how verbose error messages can reveal sensitive implementation details, such as framework version numbers.
Such information can aid attackers in identifying and targeting known vulnerabilities in third-party components used by the application.

Objective
Trigger an error that discloses the framework version in use. Extract the version number of the third-party component and submit it to complete the lab.

Technical Walkthrough
1. Reconnaissance

Logged into the application and browsed to a product page.

Captured the HTTP request for the product page in Burp Suite Proxy.

Identified a productId parameter in the URL query string:

GET /product?productId=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: <LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net
2. Input Manipulation

Sent the request to Burp Repeater.

Modified the productId parameter to use a string instead of an integer:

GET /product?productId="test" HTTP/1.1
Host: <LAB-ID>.web-security-academy.net
3. Error Message Analysis

The server returned a full stack trace, indicating an unhandled exception.

The error message exposed internal details, including the version of the framework in use:

Apache Struts 2 2.3.31
Result
The version number 2.3.31 of Apache Struts 2 was extracted from the verbose error message.
Submitting this value successfully completed the lab.

Mitigation
To prevent this type of information disclosure in real-world applications:

Disable verbose error messages in production environments.

Implement custom error pages that reveal no internal details.

Use centralized exception handling to capture and log errors securely without exposing them to users.

Regularly update and patch third-party frameworks to fix known vulnerabilities.
