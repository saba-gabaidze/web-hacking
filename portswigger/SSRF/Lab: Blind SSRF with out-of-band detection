Lab: Blind SSRF with Out-of-Band Detection
Difficulty: Practitioner

This one’s all about blind SSRF. The app runs some kind of analytics software that fetches the Referer header whenever you visit a product page. The goal is to abuse that to make the server send a request to Burp Collaborator.

Since this is blind, we’re not gonna see anything in the browser — but if the server makes that outbound request, it’ll show up in Burp Collaborator logs.

Step-by-step

I started by visiting any product page and intercepted the request in Burp.

Sent it to Repeater.

Then I looked for the Referer header — it was there, pointing to the product page I had just come from.

I right-clicked on it and used "Insert Collaborator Payload". That dropped in a unique URL tied to my Burp Collaborator session.

Sent the request.

Went over to the Collaborator tab and hit "Poll now".

Waited a bit... and sure enough, got a DNS lookup and an HTTP interaction from the target. That confirmed the server reached out to my Collaborator domain — so the SSRF worked.

That was enough to solve the lab.

Takeaways

The app blindly trusts the Referer header and fetches whatever URL you give it.

That opens the door for SSRF, even though there’s no response — it’s all out-of-band.

Good reminder: just because you can’t see the response doesn’t mean the attack didn’t work.
